## Cassidy talking head for Fallout 2

This package contains Cassidy talking head and English voiced lines.

### Installation
- For [UPU](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Unofficial_Patch), download `cassidy_head.dat` and one of the voice `.dat`s from the [latest release page](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Cassidy_Head/releases/latest), drop them into `mods` directory.
- Already included into [RPU](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Restoration_Project).

### Voice options
- Adam Dravean's version is the one that was included with RP 2.3.3.
- Joey Bracken's version comes in HQ (44kHz) and LQ (22kHz).

If you prefer Cassidy to be silent, you can use the head without a voice dat.
